# Class-3
My background is in finance, business strategy, and sociology.
I'm interested in using technology to improve processes, solve problems, and create efficiencies.
My career goals currently are to learn more about the operations side of the business. Specifically understanding the legacy systems, how they currently communicate with each other, and how to develop new systems to improve the current functionalities.
I've always been interested in technology from a problem solving perspective as I believe it can transform and streamline old processes as well as create new opportunities.

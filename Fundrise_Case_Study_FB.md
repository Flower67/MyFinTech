# Fundrise: Untapped Private Real Estate Market Inefficiencies

![Fundrise Platform Picture](https://ibb.co/MpL670y)

## Overview and Origin

Fundrise was founded in June of 2012 by Benjamin Miller. Its goal is to provide individual US investors with access to private real estate investments at a nominal cost. The company is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and as of April 2020, has 124 employees. Owning real estate has historically been a long-term predictor of wealth. However, it is often inaccessible to many Americans due to the down payment or other financial barriers. Ben Miller and his team saw this as an opportunity to use technology to create a diversified portfolio of private real assets and raise capital through crowdfunding to purchase these assets. This would remove the barrier to entry as multiple investors could combine their deposits to purchase a property, allow each investor to own a portion of that asset relative to their deposit, and lastly provide increased returns as private real estate markets yield more than public ones.

Fundrise is the first ever robo-advisor for real estate. They provide an online platform where users can sign up with as little as $500 and begin investing in propertied. Users are offered a three-tiered plan that targets their initial investment amounts. The three tiers are Core, Advanced, and Premium. They each have a $1,000, $10,000, and $100,000 initial investment amount, respectively. The Core plan is targeted towards early professionals who are new to investing and are interested in a diversified, hands-off investment. The Advanced plan targets more established professionals who are seeking additional investments and have prior experience in this domain. Lastly, the premium package is for high net worth individuals or accredited investors with a wealth of experience in real estate investing. For those who do not fit into the three plans, Fundrise offers a $500 investment Starter Plan. Based on their initial deposits, investors must pay 0.15% for annual investment advisory fees, or 0.15% for every $1,000 invested. Similarly, investors also pay a 0.85% annual asset management fee, or 0.85% for every $1,000 invested. In addition to these fees, Fundrise offers shares of their Class B Common Stock and as of December 2019, had raised approximately $59.7 million. Collectively, the company has raised $1.1 billion in debt and equity.

## Business Activities

Fundrise aims to provide access to traditionally unattainable private real estate markets at a low cost. Prior to Fundrise, the only way to access private real estate markets was to actually purchase those assets or be an institutional investor with a vast amount of disposable income; hundreds of thousands of dollars at the minimum. By reducing the upfront costs for investors, Fundrise broadens their customer base to include almost all of the US retail investor population, approximately 50% of the US population. With their platform, an investor with $500 in disposable income can invest in a highly diversified fund of private real estate assets. These assets include, but are not limited to, single-family homes, multifamily properties, retail, hotels, and properties that are under construction. 

Similarly, Fundrise was modeled to provide more fee transparency than other publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate private equity firms, and investment advisors. They have eliminated the middlemen by conducting all services in-house; from providing customer support to administrating funds and developing an industry-leading platform. This allows their advisor fees, 0.15%/$1,000/year, to be much lower than their competitors. Vanguard charges 0.20%/$1,000/quarter for Vanguard Digital Advisor which offers services to investors with $3,000 to $49,999 to be managed and 0.30%/$1,000/quarter for Vanguard Personal Advisor Services for clients with more than $50,000 to be managed. In addition to advisory fees, Fundrise charges 0.85%/$1,000/year in management fees. These are built into their eREITs and eFunds as the underlying assets incur operating expenses such as construction, re-zoning, renovations, etc. Individual users are not charged per asset, but instead will be billed an annual amount relative to their share of the portfolio. When compared to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust and Starwood Real Estate Income Trust, which charge annual management fees of 1.25%, Fundrise is clearly less expensive at 40 basis points lower. This clear and transparent fee structure allows investors to know what they are being charged for and at which frequency. This allows investors to retain more of their annual returns as well as increases their long-term earnings. 

Given that Fundrise is predominantly geared towards unaccredited investors, they offer the first ever real estate robo-advisor to their clients. This allows clients to select their investment strategy—supplemental income, balanced investing, or long-term growth—and the robo-advisor will determine how to best allocate their funds. This trademarked technology, eDirect Technology, is a cloud-based software that combines data-driven underwriting, real-time asset management, a proprietary accounting and reporting software, and a web-based investing platform to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies in the private real estate market. Essentially, the automated technology combines the properties’ loan-level data, their physical characteristics, and the markets that they are in to determine if the current market value of the asset is correct. If the property value is lower than that calculated by the software, Fundrise will take advantage of this pricing inefficiency.

Private real estate markets are often more price inefficient than public real estate markets. Typically, there is significantly less information available on private real assets, there is no platform to trade these investments, there are little opportunities for arbitrage, and lower liquidity. All of which lead these assets to be priced at a 20-65% discount. This led Fundrise to develop a proprietary technology to take advantage of this pricing inefficiency. Their technology is built into their web-based trading platform which allows investors to view acquired assets and those soon-to-be acquired. The web-based platform is built using the programming language, Java, and the content is distributed to clients using the content delivery network, Amazon CloudFront. To ensure that the market analysis matches the financial goals of a given investor, Fundrise uses Mixpanel and Google Analytics to provide targeted asset allocation.

## Landscape

Fundrise operates withing the domain of robo-advising as it pertains to private real estate investing. Robo-advising is a fairly new domain as it has only been widely used since the 2008 financial crisis. Prior to 2008, private banks and wealth management firms used web interfaces to determine risk-return distributions for their clients. However, they still relied heavily on human advisors to interact with clients and articulate portfolio allocations. In 2010, robo-advising fully emerged as an industry with the growing popularity of Betterment, a goal-based investing company. Since then, over 100 robo-advising services and companies have emerged. They predominantly have similar portfolio management services, which invest in already established exchange traded funds (ETFs), pick individual investments for a well-balanced portfolio, or invest in all-equity or all-debt instruments. Fundrise, on the other hand, is the first robo-advising platform specific to the private real estate market. 

Several industry giants were late movers—Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) was founded in 2015 and Starwood Real Estate Income Trust was founded in 2017. Both offer a similar REIT/fund structure to Fundrise where they issue shares of stock to build up capital for the purchasing of private real assets. They also redistribute the profits in the form of monthly dividends to their investors. However, BREIT requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500 while Starwood Real Estate Income Trust requires $5,000. This poses a significant entry barrier compared to the $500 that Fundrise requires. Similarly, as mentioned earlier, both firms have significantly higher fees—a 3.5% fee for sales commission (none under Fundrise), 0.85% servicing fee (0.15% for Fundrise), a 1.25% annual management fee (0.85% for Fundrise), and 12.5% fee for profits above the 5% preferred return hurdle (none under Fundrise). This fee structure along with the initial investment requirement make these funds less appealing for the retail investor.
